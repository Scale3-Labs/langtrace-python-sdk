Understand what SQL injection is: SQL injection is a type of cyber attack where attackers insert malicious SQL statements into input fields on a website to manipulate the database. It occurs when a user input is not properly validated and sanitized before being executed as an SQL query, allowing attackers to insert their own SQL code.\n\n2. Use parameterized queries: Parameterized queries are SQL statements that include placeholders for parameters. These parameters are then securely passed into the query separately, ensuring that user input is treated as data and not as executable code. This prevents attackers from injecting malicious SQL statements.\n\n3. Input validation and sanitization: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to ensure they adhere to specified data types and formats. Input validation checks if the input meets certain criteria, while sanitization removes potentially harmful characters or code. By implementing strict input validation and sanitization, you can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks.\n\n4. Use stored procedures: Stored procedures are precompiled SQL queries that are stored in the database and can be called by the application. By utilizing stored procedures, you limit the surface area for potential SQL injection attacks, as the procedures do not directly concatenate user input with SQL code, making them inherently more secure.\n\n5.

However, it could be improved by addressing all the points mentioned in the answer, not just focusing on one specific method (Parameterized Queries). Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide examples or further explanation to better illustrate each point. Furthermore, it would be helpful to emphasize the importance of not relying solely on one method but rather implementing a combination of strategies to enhance security.\n***\n[END DATA]\n\nIf the original answer is already correct, just repeat the original answer exactly.
